`mini007` provides a lightweight and extensible framework multi-agents orchestration processes capable of decomposing complex tasks and assigning them to specialized agents. 

Each `agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. `mini007` relies heavily on the excellent `ellmer` package but aims to make it easy to create a process where multiple specialized agents help each other in order to execute a task.

`mini007` provides two types of agents: 

- A normal `Agent` containing a name and an instruction, 
- and a `LeadAgent` which will take a complex prompt, split it, assign to the adequate agents and retrieve the response. 


#### Highlights

🧠 Memory and identity for each agent via `uuid` and message history.

⚙️ Built-in task decomposition and delegation via `LLM`.

🔄 Agent-to-agent orchestration with result chaining.

🌐 Compatible with any OpenAI-style chat model via `ellmer`.

You can install the development version of `mini007` like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/mini007")
```


### Creating an Agent

Creating an agent is really easy, you need to provide the `OpenAI` API key and the `model` name. Note that at the moment, only `OpenAI` models are supported but if needed, feel free to open an issue: 


```{r}
library(mini007)
```


```{r}
polar_bear_researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "POLAR BEAR RESEARCHER",
  instruction = "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears.",
  model = "gpt-4.1-mini", 
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

Each created Agent has an `agent_id`, a `name` and an `instruction`. 
```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$agent_id
```

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$name
```

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$instruction
```
As mentioned previously, in a technical term, an Agent is an extension of an `ellmer` object. You can execute the following in order to access the underlying `ellmer` object:


```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
```
You can tweak the `llm_object` the same way as an `ellmer` object (set a structured output, define a set of tools and so on). 

An agent can provide the answer to a prompt using the `invoke` method: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$invoke("Are polar bears dangerous for humans?")
```


You can also retrieve a list that displays the history of the agent:

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$messages
```
Or the `ellmer` way: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
```


### Creating a multi-agents orchestraction 


We can create as many Agents as we want, the `LeadAgent` will dispatch the instructions to the agents and provide with the final answer back. Let's create two other Agents, a `summarizer` and a `translator`: 


```{r}

researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "researcher",
  instruction = "You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer factual questions with detailed and accurate information. Do not answer with more than 2 lines",
  model = "gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

summarizer <- Agent$new(
  name = "summarizer",
  instruction = "You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 distinct bullet points.",
  model = "gpt-4.1-mini", 
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

translator <- Agent$new(
  name = "translator",
  instruction = "Your role is to translate a text from English to German",
  model = "gpt-4.1-mini", 
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```


Now, the most important part is to create a `LeadAgent`: 

```{r}
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  model = "gpt-4.1-mini", 
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

Note that the `LeadAgent` cannot receive an `instruction` as it has already the necessary instructions. 

Next, we need to assign the Agents to `LeadAgent`, we do it as follows: 

```{r}
lead_agent$register_agents(c(researcher, summarizer, translator))
lead_agent$agents
```
You can see from above that the above defined Agents are now assigned to the `LeadAgent`. 

In order now to execute the workflow, we just need to call the `invoke` method which will behind the scene delegate the prompts to suitable Agents and retrieve back the final information: 

```{r}
response <- lead_agent$invoke("Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German.")
```

```{r}
response
```

If you want to inspect the multi-agents orchestration, you have access to the `agents_interaction` object: 

```{r}
lead_agent$agents_interaction
```


The above example is extremely simple, the usefulness of `mini007` would shine in more complex processes where a multi-agent sequential orchestration has a higher value added.

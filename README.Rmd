`mini007` provides a lightweight and extensible framework for multi-agents orchestration processes capable of decomposing complex tasks and assigning them to specialized agents. 

Each `agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. `mini007` relies heavily on the excellent `ellmer` package but aims to make it easy to create a process where multiple specialized agents help each other sequentially in order to execute a task.

`mini007` provides two types of agents: 

- A normal `Agent` containing a name and an instruction, 
- and a `LeadAgent` which will take a complex prompt, split it, assign to the adequate agents and retrieve the response. 

#### Highlights

üß† Memory and identity for each agent via `uuid` and message history.

‚öôÔ∏è Built-in task decomposition and delegation via `LLM`.

üîÑ Agent-to-agent orchestration with result chaining.

üåê Compatible with any chat model supported by `ellmer`.

üßë Possibility to set a Human In The Loop (`HITL`) at various execution steps

You can install `mini007` from `CRAN` with: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mini007")
```

```{r}
library(mini007)
```


### Creating an Agent

An Agent is built upon an LLM object created by the `ellmer` package, in the following examples, we'll work with the `OpenAI` models, however you can use any model/combination of models you want: 

```{r}
# no need to provide the system prompt, it will be set when creating the
# agent (see the 'instruction' parameter)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

```

After initializing the `ellmer` LLM object, creating the Agent is straightforward: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "POLAR BEAR RESEARCHER",
  instruction = "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Each created Agent has an `agent_id` (among other meta information): 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$agent_id
```

At any time, you can tweak the `llm_object`: 
```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
```

An agent can provide the answer to a prompt using the `invoke` method: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$invoke("Are polar bears dangerous for humans?")
```


You can also retrieve a list that displays the history of the agent:

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$messages
```
Or the `ellmer` way: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
```

### Managing Agent Conversation History

The `clear_and_summarise_messages` method allows you to compress an agent's conversation history into a concise summary and clear the message history while preserving context. This is useful for maintaining memory efficiency while keeping important conversation context.

```{r}
# After several interactions, summarise and clear the conversation history
polar_bear_researcher$clear_and_summarise_messages()
polar_bear_researcher$messages
```

This method summarises all previous conversations into a paragraph and appends it to the system prompt, then clears the conversation history. The agent retains the context but with reduced memory usage.

#### Keep only the most recent messages with `keep_last_n_messages()`

When a conversation grows long, you can keep just the last N messages while preserving the system prompt. This helps control token usage without fully resetting context.

```{r}
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "history_manager",
  instruction = "You are a concise assistant.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$invoke("What is the capital of Italy?")
agent$invoke("What is the capital of Germany?")
agent$invoke("What is the capital of Algeria?")
agent$messages
```

```{r}
# Keep only the last message (system prompt is preserved)
agent$keep_last_n_messages(n = 1)
agent$messages
```
### Manually Adding Messages to an Agent‚Äôs History

You can inject any message (system, user, or assistant) directly into an Agent‚Äôs history with `add_message(role, content)`. This is helpful to reconstruct, supplement, or simulate conversation steps.

- **add_message(role, content)**:
  - `role`: "user", "assistant", or "system"
  - `content`: The text message to add

```{r, eval=TRUE}
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)
agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "Pizza expert",
  instruction = "You are a Pizza expert",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Add a user message, an assistant reply, and a system instruction:
agent$add_message("user", "Where can I find the best pizza in the world?")
agent$add_message("assistant", "You can find the best pizza in the world in Algiers, Algeria. It's tasty and crunchy.")

# View conversation history
agent$messages
```

This makes it easy to reconstruct or extend sessions, provide custom context, or insert notes for debugging/testing purposes.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
agent$invoke("What did you say? I didn't understand. could you repeat please")
```

### Updating the system instruction during a session

Use `update_instruction(new_instruction)` to change the Agent‚Äôs system prompt mid-session. The first system message and the underlying `ellmer` system prompt are both updated.

```{r}
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "reconfigurable",
  instruction = "You are a helpful assistant.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$update_instruction("You are a strictly concise assistant. Answer in one sentence.")

agent$messages
```

### Budget and cost control

You can limit how much an `Agent` is allowed to spend and decide what should happen as the budget is approached or exceeded. Use `set_budget()` to define the maximum spend (in USD), and `set_budget_policy()` to control warnings and over-budget behavior.

- **set_budget(amount_in_usd)**: sets the absolute budget for the agent.
- **set_budget_policy(on_exceed, warn_at)**:
  - **on_exceed**: one of `"abort"`, `"warn"`, or `"ask"`.
    - **abort**: stop with an error when the budget is exceeded.
    - **warn**: emit a warning and continue.
    - **ask**: interactively ask what to do when the budget is exceeded.
  - **warn_at**: a fraction in (0, 1); triggers a one-time warning when spending reaches that fraction of the budget (default `0.8`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# An API KEY is required to invoke the Agent
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "cost_conscious_assistant",
  instruction = "Answer succinctly.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Set a 5 USD budget
agent$set_budget(5)

# Warn at 90% of the budget and ask what to do if exceeded
agent$set_budget_policy(on_exceed = "ask", warn_at = 0.9)

# Normal usage
agent$invoke("Give me a one-sentence fun fact about Algeria.")
```

The current policy is echoed when setting the budget. You can update the policy at any time before or during an interaction lifecycle to adapt to your workflow's tolerance for cost overruns.

#### Inspecting usage and estimated cost

Call `get_usage_stats()` to retrieve total tokens, estimated cost, and budget information (if set).

```{r}
stats <- agent$get_usage_stats()
stats
```

### Generate and execute R code from natural language

`generate_execute_r_code()` lets an `Agent` translate a natural-language task description into R code, optionally validate its syntax, and (optionally) execute it.

- **code_description**: a plain-English description of the R code to generate.
- **validate**: `TRUE` to run a syntax validation step on the generated code first.
- **execute**: `TRUE` to execute the generated code (requires successful validation).
- **interactive**: if `TRUE`, shows the code and asks for confirmation before executing.
- **env**: environment where code will run when `execute = TRUE` (default `globalenv()`).

Safety notes:
- Set `validate = TRUE` and review the printed code before execution.
- Keep `interactive = TRUE` to require an explicit confirmation before running code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

r_assistant <- Agent$new(
  name = "R Code Assistant",
  instruction = "You are an expert R programmer.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Generate code to summarise the built-in mtcars data frame,
# validate it, then execute after interactive confirmation.
r_assistant$generate_execute_r_code(
  code_description = "Calculate the summary of the mtcars dataframe",
  validate = TRUE,
  execute = TRUE,
  interactive = TRUE, 
  env = globalenv()
)
```

### Creating a multi-agents orchestraction 

We can create as many Agents as we want, the `LeadAgent` will dispatch the instructions to the agents and provide with the final answer back. Let's create three Agents, a `researcher`, a `summarizer` and a `translator`: 


```{r}

researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "researcher",
  instruction = "You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer factual questions with detailed and accurate information. Do not answer with more than 2 lines",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

summarizer <- Agent$new(
  name = "summarizer",
  instruction = "You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 distinct bullet points.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

translator <- Agent$new(
  name = "translator",
  instruction = "Your role is to translate a text from English to German",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```


Now, the most important part is to create a `LeadAgent`: 

```{r}
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Note that the `LeadAgent` cannot receive an `instruction` as it has already the necessary instructions. 

Next, we need to assign the Agents to `LeadAgent`, we do it as follows: 

```{r}
lead_agent$register_agents(c(researcher, summarizer, translator))
lead_agent$agents
```

Before executing your prompt, you can ask the `LeadAgent` to generate a plan so that you can see which `Agent` will be used for which prompt, you can do it as follows:

```{r}
prompt_to_execute <- "Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German."

plan <- lead_agent$generate_plan(prompt_to_execute)
plan
```

Now, in order now to execute the workflow, we just need to call the `invoke` method which will behind the scene delegate the prompts to suitable Agents and retrieve back the final information: 

```{r}
response <- lead_agent$invoke("Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German.")
```

```{r}
response
```

If you want to inspect the multi-agents orchestration, you have access to the `agents_interaction` object: 

```{r}
lead_agent$agents_interaction
```


The above example is extremely simple, the usefulness of `mini007` would shine in more complex processes where a multi-agent sequential orchestration has a higher value added. 

### Visualizing agent plans with `visualize_plan()`

Sometimes, before running your workflow, it is helpful to view the orchestration as a visual diagram, showing the sequence of agents and which prompt each will receive. After generating a plan, you can call `visualize_plan()`:

This function displays the agents in workflow order as labeled boxes. Hovering a box reveals the delegated prompt. The visualization uses the `DiagrammeR` package. If no plan exists, it asks you to generate one first.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
lead_agent$visualize_plan()
```

## Broadcasting 

If you want to compare several `LLM` models, the `LeadAgent` provides a `broadcast` method that allows you to send a prompt to several different agents and get the result for each agent back in order to make a comparison and potentially choose the best agent/model for the defined prompt: 

Let's go through an example: 

```{r}
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_nano_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_nano_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)
```

```{r}

lead_agent$clear_agents() # removing previous agents
lead_agent$register_agents(c(openai_4_1_agent, openai_4_1_nano_agent))
```


```{r}
lead_agent$broadcast(prompt = "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?")
```

You can also access the history of the `broadcasting` using the `broadcast_history` attribute: 


```{r}
lead_agent$broadcast_history
```


## Tool specification 

As mentioned previously, an `Agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. As such, you can define a tool that will be used, the exact same way as in `ellmer`. Suppose, we want to get the weather in `Algiers` through a function (Tool). Let's first create the `Agents`: 


```{r}
openai_llm_object <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

assistant <- Agent$new(
  name = "assistant",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant that answers question. Do not answer with more than 1 sentence.",
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

weather_assistant <- Agent$new(
  name = "weather_assistant",
  instruction = "You role is to provide weather assistance.",
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)
```

Now, let's define the `tool` that we'll be using, using `ellmer` it's quite straightforward: 

```{r}
get_weather_in_algiers <- ellmer::tool(
  function() {
    "35 degrees Celcius, it's sunny and there's no precipitation."
  },
  name = "get_weather_in_algiers",
  description = "Provide the current weather in Algiers, Algeria."
)
```

Our `tool` defined, the next step is to register it within the suitable `Agent`, in our case, the `weather_assistant` `Agent`: 

```{r}
weather_assistant$llm_object$register_tool(get_weather_in_algiers)
```

That's it, now the last step is to create the `LeadAgent`, register the `Agents` that we need and call the `invoke` method:  

```{r}
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

lead_agent$register_agents(c(assistant, weather_assistant))

lead_agent$invoke(
  "Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, then tell me how's the weather in Algiers?"
)
```


## Human In The Loop (HITL)

When executing an LLM workflow that relies on many steps, you can set `Human In The Loop` (`HITL`) trigger that will check the model's response at a specific step. You can define a `HITL` trigger after defining a `LeadAgent` as follows:

```{r}
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

lead_agent$set_hitl(steps = 1)

lead_agent$hitl_steps
```
After setting the `HITL` to step 1, the workflow execution will pose and give the user 3 choices: 

1. Continue the execution of the workflow as it is;
2. Change manually the answer of the specified step and continue the execution of the workflow;
3. Stop the execution of the workflow (hard error);

Note that you can set a `HITL` at several steps, for example `lead_agent$set_hitl(steps = c(1, 2))` will set the `HITL` at step 1 and step 2. 


## Judge as a decision process 

Sometimes you want to send a prompt to several agents and pick the best answer. In order to choose the best prompt, you can also rely on the `Lead` Agent which will act a dudge and pick for you the best answer. You can use the `judge_and_choose_best_response` method as follows: 

```{r}
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_1 <- Agent$new(
  name = "stylist",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_2 <- Agent$new(
  name = "stylist2",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Stylist Leader",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

stylist_lead_agent$register_agents(c(stylist_1, stylist_2))

best_answer <- stylist_lead_agent$judge_and_choose_best_response(
  "what's the best way to wear a blue kalvin klein shirt in winter with a pink pair of trousers?"
)

best_answer
```

### Exporting and Loading Agent Conversation History

You can save an agent‚Äôs conversation history to a file and reload it later. This allows you to archive, transfer, or resume agent sessions across R sessions or machines.

- **export_messages_history(file_path)**: Saves the current conversation to a JSON file. 
- **load_messages_history(file_path)**: Loads a saved conversation history from a JSON file, replacing the agent‚Äôs current history.

In both methods, if you omit the `file_path` parameter, a default file named `"<getwd()>/<agent_name>_messages.json"` is used.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)
agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "session_agent",
  instruction = "You are a persistent researcher.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Interact with the agent
agent$invoke("Tell me something interesting about volcanoes.")

# Save the conversation
agent$export_messages_history("volcano_session.json")

# ...Later, or in a new session...
# Restore the conversation
agent$load_messages_history("volcano_session.json")
# agent$messages  # Displays current history
```

This makes it easy to archive progress and resume complex, context-rich agent sessions at any time.

### Resetting conversation history

If you want to clear the conversation while preserving the current system prompt, use `reset_conversation_history()`.

```{r}
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "session_reset",
  instruction = "You are an assistant.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$invoke("Tell me a short fun fact about dates (the fruit).")
agent$invoke("And one more.")

# Clear all messages except the system prompt
agent$reset_conversation_history()
agent$messages
```

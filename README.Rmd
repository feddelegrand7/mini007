`mini007` provides a lightweight and extensible framework for multi-agents orchestration processes capable of decomposing complex tasks and assigning them to specialized agents. 

Each `agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. `mini007` relies heavily on the excellent `ellmer` package but aims to make it easy to create a process where multiple specialized agents help each other sequentially in order to execute a task.

`mini007` provides two types of agents: 

- A normal `Agent` containing a name and an instruction, 
- and a `LeadAgent` which will take a complex prompt, split it, assign to the adequate agents and retrieve the response. 


#### Highlights

🧠 Memory and identity for each agent via `uuid` and message history.

⚙️ Built-in task decomposition and delegation via `LLM`.

🔄 Agent-to-agent orchestration with result chaining.

🌐 Compatible with any chat model supported by `ellmer`.

You can install the development version of `mini007` like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/mini007")
```


```{r}
library(mini007)
```


### Creating an Agent



An Agent is built upon an LLM object created by the `ellmer` package, in the following examples, we'll work with the `OpenAI` models, however you can use any model/combination of models you want: 



```{r}
# no need to provide the system prompt, it will be set when creating the
# agent (see the 'instruction' parameter)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

```

After initialising the `ellmer` LLM object, creating the Agent is straightforward: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "POLAR BEAR RESEARCHER",
  instruction = "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Each created Agent has an `agent_id` (among other meta information): 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$agent_id
```

At any time, you can tweak the `llm_object`: 
```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
```

An agent can provide the answer to a prompt using the `invoke` method: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$invoke("Are polar bears dangerous for humans?")
```


You can also retrieve a list that displays the history of the agent:

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$messages
```
Or the `ellmer` way: 

```{r}
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
```


### Creating a multi-agents orchestraction 

We can create as many Agents as we want, the `LeadAgent` will dispatch the instructions to the agents and provide with the final answer back. Let's create three Agents, a `researcher`, a `summarizer` and a `translator`: 


```{r}

researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "researcher",
  instruction = "You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer factual questions with detailed and accurate information. Do not answer with more than 2 lines",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

summarizer <- Agent$new(
  name = "summarizer",
  instruction = "You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 distinct bullet points.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

translator <- Agent$new(
  name = "translator",
  instruction = "Your role is to translate a text from English to German",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```


Now, the most important part is to create a `LeadAgent`: 

```{r}
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Note that the `LeadAgent` cannot receive an `instruction` as it has already the necessary instructions. 

Next, we need to assign the Agents to `LeadAgent`, we do it as follows: 

```{r}
lead_agent$register_agents(c(researcher, summarizer, translator))
lead_agent$agents
```

In order now to execute the workflow, we just need to call the `invoke` method which will behind the scene delegate the prompts to suitable Agents and retrieve back the final information: 

```{r}
response <- lead_agent$invoke("Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German.")
```

```{r}
response
```

If you want to inspect the multi-agents orchestration, you have access to the `agents_interaction` object: 

```{r}
lead_agent$agents_interaction
```


The above example is extremely simple, the usefulness of `mini007` would shine in more complex processes where a multi-agent sequential orchestration has a higher value added. 


## Broadcasting 

If you want to compare several `LLM` models, the `LeadAgent` provides a `broadcast` method that allows you to send a prompt to several different agents and get the result for each agent back in order to make a comparison and potentially choose the best agent/model for the defined prompt: 

Let's go through an example: 


```{r}
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_nano_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_nano_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)
```

```{r}

lead_agent$clear_agents() # removing previous agents
lead_agent$register_agents(c(openai_4_1_agent, openai_4_1_nano_agent))
```


```{r}
lead_agent$broadcast(prompt = "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?")
```

You can also access the history of the `broadcasting` using the `broadcast_history` attribute: 


```{r}
lead_agent$broadcast_history
```

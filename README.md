`mini007` provides a lightweight and extensible framework for
multi-agents orchestration processes capable of decomposing complex
tasks and assigning them to specialized agents.

Each `agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. `mini007` relies
heavily on the excellent `ellmer` package but aims to make it easy to
create a process where multiple specialized agents help each other
sequentially in order to execute a task.

`mini007` provides two types of agents:

- A normal `Agent` containing a name and an instruction,
- and a `LeadAgent` which will take a complex prompt, split it, assign
  to the adequate agents and retrieve the response.

#### Highlights

🧠 Memory and identity for each agent via `uuid` and message history.

⚙️ Built-in task decomposition and delegation via `LLM`.

🔄 Agent-to-agent orchestration with result chaining.

🌐 Compatible with any chat model supported by `ellmer`.

🧑 Possibility to set a Human In The Loop (`HITL`) at various execution
steps

You can install `mini007` from `CRAN` with:

``` r
install.packages("mini007")
```

``` r
library(mini007)
```

### Creating an Agent

An Agent is built upon an LLM object created by the `ellmer` package, in
the following examples, we’ll work with the `OpenAI` models, however you
can use any model/combination of models you want:

``` r
# no need to provide the system prompt, it will be set when creating the
# agent (see the 'instruction' parameter)

retrieve_open_ai_credential <- function() {
  Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
}

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)
```

After initializing the `ellmer` LLM object, creating the Agent is
straightforward:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "POLAR BEAR RESEARCHER",
  instruction = "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Each created Agent has an `agent_id` (among other meta information):

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$agent_id
#> [1] "be482bc7-54dd-4759-935c-3d3f57794717"
```

At any time, you can tweak the `llm_object`:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=1 input=0 output=0 cost=$0.00>
#> ── system ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max.
```

An agent can provide the answer to a prompt using the `invoke` method:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$invoke("Are polar bears dangerous for humans?")
#> Yes, polar bears can be dangerous to humans as they are powerful predators and 
#> may attack if threatened or hungry.
```

You can also retrieve a list that displays the history of the agent:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "Are polar bears dangerous for humans?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> [1] "Yes, polar bears can be dangerous to humans as they are powerful predators and may attack if threatened or hungry."
```

Or the `ellmer` way:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=3 input=43 output=23 cost=$0.00>
#> ── system ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max.
#> ── user ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> Are polar bears dangerous for humans?
#> ── assistant [input=43 output=23 cost=$0.00] ───────────────────────────────────
#> Yes, polar bears can be dangerous to humans as they are powerful predators and may attack if threatened or hungry.
```

### Managing Agent Conversation History

The `clear_and_summarise_messages` method allows you to compress an
agent’s conversation history into a concise summary and clear the
message history while preserving context. This is useful for maintaining
memory efficiency while keeping important conversation context.

``` r
# After several interactions, summarise and clear the conversation history
polar_bear_researcher$clear_and_summarise_messages()
#> ✔ Conversation history summarised and appended to system prompt.
#> ℹ Summary: The user asked if polar bears are dangerous to humans, and the assistant responded that polar bears ...
polar_bear_researcher$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max. \n\n--- Conversation Summary ---\n The user asked if polar bears are dangerous to humans, and the assistant responded that polar bears can indeed be dangerous since they are powerful predators and may attack when threatened or hungry."
```

This method summarises all previous conversations into a paragraph and
appends it to the system prompt, then clears the conversation history.
The agent retains the context but with reduced memory usage.

#### Keep only the most recent messages with `keep_last_n_messages()`

When a conversation grows long, you can keep just the last N messages
while preserving the system prompt. This helps control token usage
without fully resetting context.

``` r
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "history_manager",
  instruction = "You are a concise assistant.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$invoke("What is the capital of Italy?")
#> The capital of Italy is Rome.
agent$invoke("What is the capital of Germany?")
#> The capital of Germany is Berlin.
agent$invoke("What is the capital of Algeria?")
#> The capital of Algeria is Algiers.
agent$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are a concise assistant."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "What is the capital of Italy?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> [1] "The capital of Italy is Rome."
#> 
#> 
#> [[4]]
#> [[4]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[4]]$content
#> [1] "What is the capital of Germany?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[5]]
#> [[5]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[5]]$content
#> [1] "The capital of Germany is Berlin."
#> 
#> 
#> [[6]]
#> [[6]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[6]]$content
#> [1] "What is the capital of Algeria?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[7]]
#> [[7]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[7]]$content
#> [1] "The capital of Algeria is Algiers."
```

``` r
# Keep only the last 2 messages (system prompt is preserved)
agent$keep_last_n_messages(n = 2)
#> ✔ Conversation truncated to last 2 messages.
agent$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are a concise assistant."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "What is the capital of Algeria?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> [1] "The capital of Algeria is Algiers."
```

### Manually Adding Messages to an Agent’s History

You can inject any message (system, user, or assistant) directly into an
Agent’s history with `add_message(role, content)`. This is helpful to
reconstruct, supplement, or simulate conversation steps.

- **add_message(role, content)**:
  - `role`: “user”, “assistant”, or “system”
  - `content`: The text message to add

``` r
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)
agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "Pizza expert",
  instruction = "You are a Pizza expert",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Add a user message, an assistant reply, and a system instruction:
agent$add_message("user", "Where can I find the best pizza in the world?")
#> ✔ Added user message: Where can I find the best pizza in the world?...
agent$add_message("assistant", "You can find the best pizza in the world in Algiers, Algeria. It's tasty and crunchy.")
#> ✔ Added assistant message: You can find the best pizza in the world in Algier...

# View conversation history
agent$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are a Pizza expert"
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "Where can I find the best pizza in the world?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> [1] "You can find the best pizza in the world in Algiers, Algeria. It's tasty and crunchy."
```

This makes it easy to reconstruct or extend sessions, provide custom
context, or insert notes for debugging/testing purposes.

``` r
agent$invoke("summarise the previous conversation")
#> You asked where to find the best pizza in the world, and I replied that it can 
#> be found in Algiers, Algeria, known for its tasty and crunchy pizza.
```

### Sync between `messages` and `turns`

You can modify the `messages` object as you please, this will be
automatically translated to the suitable `turns` required by `ellmer`:

``` r
agent$messages[[5]]$content <- "Obivously you asked me about the best pizza in the world which is of course in Algiery!"

agent$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are a Pizza expert"
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "Where can I find the best pizza in the world?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> [1] "You can find the best pizza in the world in Algiers, Algeria. It's tasty and crunchy."
#> 
#> 
#> [[4]]
#> [[4]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[4]]$content
#> [1] "summarise the previous conversation"
#> 
#> 
#> [[5]]
#> [[5]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[5]]$content
#> [1] "Obivously you asked me about the best pizza in the world which is of course in Algiery!"
```

The underlying ellmer object:

``` r
agent$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=5 input=62 output=36>
#> ── system ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> You are a Pizza expert
#> ── user ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> Where can I find the best pizza in the world?
#> ── assistant [input=0 output=0] ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> You can find the best pizza in the world in Algiers, Algeria. It's tasty and crunchy.
#> ── user ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> summarise the previous conversation
#> ── assistant [input=62 output=36] ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#> Obivously you asked me about the best pizza in the world which is of course in Algiery!
```

### Resetting conversation history

If you want to clear the conversation while preserving the current
system prompt, use `reset_conversation_history()`.

``` r
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "session_reset",
  instruction = "You are an assistant.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$invoke("Tell me a short fun fact about dates (the fruit).")
#> Sure! Did you know that date palms can live for over 100 years and produce 
#> fruit for up to 70 years? Some date palm trees have been known to still be 
#> fruitful even after a century!
agent$invoke("And one more.")
#> Here's another fun fact: Dates were one of the first cultivated fruits, with 
#> evidence of date farming dating back over 6,000 years in the Middle East!

# Clear all messages except the system prompt
agent$reset_conversation_history()
#> ✔ Conversation history reset. System prompt preserved.
agent$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are an assistant."
```

### Exporting and Loading Agent Conversation History

You can save an agent’s conversation history to a file and reload it
later. This allows you to archive, transfer, or resume agent sessions
across R sessions or machines.

- **export_messages_history(file_path)**: Saves the current conversation
  to a JSON file.
- **load_messages_history(file_path)**: Loads a saved conversation
  history from a JSON file, replacing the agent’s current history.

In both methods, if you omit the `file_path` parameter, a default file
named `"<getwd()>/<agent_name>_messages.json"` is used.

``` r
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)
agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "session_agent",
  instruction = "You are a persistent researcher.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Interact with the agent
agent$invoke("Tell me something interesting about volcanoes.")

# Save the conversation
agent$export_messages_history("volcano_session.json")

# ...Later, or in a new session...
# Restore the conversation
agent$load_messages_history("volcano_session.json")
# agent$messages  # Displays current history
```

### Updating the system instruction during a session

Use `update_instruction(new_instruction)` to change the Agent’s system
prompt mid-session. The first system message and the underlying `ellmer`
system prompt are both updated.

``` r
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "reconfigurable",
  instruction = "You are a helpful assistant.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$update_instruction("You are a strictly concise assistant. Answer in one sentence.")
#> ✔ Instruction successfully updated
#> ℹ Old: You are a helpful assistant....
#> ℹ New: You are a strictly concise assistant. Answer in on...

agent$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are a strictly concise assistant. Answer in one sentence."
```

### Budget and cost control

You can limit how much an `Agent` is allowed to spend and decide what
should happen as the budget is approached or exceeded. Use
`set_budget()` to define the maximum spend (in USD), and
`set_budget_policy()` to control warnings and over-budget behavior.

- **set_budget(amount_in_usd)**: sets the absolute budget for the agent.
- **set_budget_policy(on_exceed, warn_at)**:
  - **on_exceed**: one of `"abort"`, `"warn"`, or `"ask"`.
    - **abort**: stop with an error when the budget is exceeded.
    - **warn**: emit a warning and continue.
    - **ask**: interactively ask what to do when the budget is exceeded.
  - **warn_at**: a fraction in (0, 1); triggers a one-time warning when
    spending reaches that fraction of the budget (default `0.8`).

``` r
# An API KEY is required to invoke the Agent
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "cost_conscious_assistant",
  instruction = "Answer succinctly.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

# Set a 5 USD budget
agent$set_budget(5)
#> ✔ Budget successfully set to 5$
#> ℹ Budget policy: on_exceed='abort', warn_at=0.8
#> ℹ Use the set_budget_policy() method to configure the budget policy.

# Warn at 90% of the budget and ask what to do if exceeded
agent$set_budget_policy(on_exceed = "ask", warn_at = 0.9)
#> ✔ Budget policy set: on_exceed='ask', warn_at=0.9

# Normal usage
agent$invoke("Give me a one-sentence fun fact about Algeria.")
#> Algeria is home to the Sahara Desert’s ancient Tassili n’Ajjer rock art, 
#> featuring some of the oldest known prehistoric cave paintings in the world!
```

The current policy is echoed when setting the budget. You can update the
policy at any time before or during an interaction lifecycle to adapt to
your workflow’s tolerance for cost overruns.

#### Inspecting usage and estimated cost

Call `get_usage_stats()` to retrieve total tokens, estimated cost, and
budget information (if set).

``` r
stats <- agent$get_usage_stats()
stats
#> $estimated_cost
#> [1] 1e-04
#> 
#> $budget
#> [1] 5
#> 
#> $budget_remaining
#> [1] 4.9999
```

### Generate and execute R code from natural language

`generate_execute_r_code()` lets an `Agent` translate a natural-language
task description into R code, optionally validate its syntax, and
(optionally) execute it.

- **code_description**: a plain-English description of the R code to
  generate.
- **validate**: `TRUE` to run a syntax validation step on the generated
  code first.
- **execute**: `TRUE` to execute the generated code (requires successful
  validation).
- **interactive**: if `TRUE`, shows the code and asks for confirmation
  before executing.
- **env**: environment where code will run when `execute = TRUE`
  (default `globalenv()`).

Safety notes: - Set `validate = TRUE` and review the printed code before
execution. - Keep `interactive = TRUE` to require an explicit
confirmation before running code.

``` r
openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

r_assistant <- Agent$new(
  name = "R Code Assistant",
  instruction = "You are an expert R programmer.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

agent$generate_execute_r_code(
   code_description = "using ggplot2, generate a scatterplot of hwy and cty in red", 
   validate = TRUE, 
   execute = TRUE, 
   interactive = FALSE
 )
#> ℹ Executing generated R code...
#> ✔ Code executed successfully
#> $description
#> [1] "using ggplot2, generate a scatterplot of hwy and cty in red"
#> 
#> $code
#> library(ggplot2);ggplot(mpg,aes(x=cty,y=hwy))+geom_point(color="red")
#> 
#> $validated
#> [1] TRUE
#> 
#> $validation_message
#> [1] "Syntax is valid"
#> 
#> $executed
#> [1] TRUE
#> 
#> $execution_result
#> $execution_result$value
```

### Creating a multi-agents orchestraction

We can create as many Agents as we want, the `LeadAgent` will dispatch
the instructions to the agents and provide with the final answer back.
Let’s create three Agents, a `researcher`, a `summarizer` and a
`translator`:

``` r

researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "researcher",
  instruction = "You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer factual questions with detailed and accurate information. Do not answer with more than 2 lines",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

summarizer <- Agent$new(
  name = "summarizer",
  instruction = "You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 distinct bullet points.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

translator <- Agent$new(
  name = "translator",
  instruction = "Your role is to translate a text from English to German",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Now, the most important part is to create a `LeadAgent`:

``` r
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Note that the `LeadAgent` cannot receive an `instruction` as it has
already the necessary instructions.

Next, we need to assign the Agents to `LeadAgent`, we do it as follows:

``` r
lead_agent$register_agents(c(researcher, summarizer, translator))
#> ✔ Agent(s) successfully registered.

lapply(lead_agent$agents, function(x) {x$name})
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "researcher"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] "summarizer"
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [1] "translator"
```

Before executing your prompt, you can ask the `LeadAgent` to generate a
plan so that you can see which `Agent` will be used for which prompt,
you can do it as follows:

``` r
prompt_to_execute <- "Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German."

plan <- lead_agent$generate_plan(prompt_to_execute)
#> ✔ Plan successfully generated.
plan
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> 422d6a82-6288-4abc-8073-c5990506c071
#> 
#> [[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "researcher"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[1]]$prompt
#> [1] "Gather current information on Algeria's economic situation, including key indicators such as GDP growth, main industries, and challenges"
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$agent_id
#> abe3d4be-f0d9-42ec-a6b9-e8dba32d8bfc
#> 
#> [[2]]$agent_name
#> [1] "summarizer"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[2]]$prompt
#> [1] "Summarize the economic situation in Algeria into 3 concise bullet points in English"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$agent_id
#> a3faa6d7-4f81-4224-b70e-ae8f7e7a40ab
#> 
#> [[3]]$agent_name
#> [1] "translator"
#> 
#> [[3]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[3]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[3]]$prompt
#> [1] "Translate the 3 bullet points from English into German"
```

Now, in order now to execute the workflow, we just need to call the
`invoke` method which will behind the scene delegate the prompts to
suitable Agents and retrieve back the final information:

``` r
response <- lead_agent$invoke("Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German.")
#> 
#> ── Using existing plan ──
#> 
```

``` r
response
#> - Die algerische Wirtschaft wächst moderat mit 2-3 % jährlich und ist stark von
#> Kohlenwasserstoffen abhängig, die über 90 % der Exporte ausmachen.  
#> - Wichtige Sektoren sind Öl und Gas, Landwirtschaft und verarbeitendes Gewerbe.
#> 
#> - Zu den großen Herausforderungen zählen die wirtschaftliche Diversifizierung, 
#> hohe Arbeitslosigkeit, die Abhängigkeit von schwankenden Ölpreisen und 
#> gesellschaftliche Forderungen nach Reformen.
```

If you want to inspect the multi-agents orchestration, you have access
to the `agents_interaction` object:

``` r
lead_agent$agents_interaction
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> 422d6a82-6288-4abc-8073-c5990506c071
#> 
#> [[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "researcher"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[1]]$prompt
#> [1] "Gather current information on Algeria's economic situation, including key indicators such as GDP growth, main industries, and challenges"

The above example is extremely simple, the usefulness of `mini007` would
shine in more complex processes where a multi-agent sequential
orchestration has a higher value added.

### Visualizing agent plans with `visualize_plan()`

Sometimes, before running your workflow, it is helpful to view the
orchestration as a visual diagram, showing the sequence of agents and
which prompt each will receive. After generating a plan, you can call
`visualize_plan()`:

This function displays the agents in workflow order as labeled boxes.
Hovering a box reveals the delegated prompt. The visualization uses the
`DiagrammeR` package. If no plan exists, it asks you to generate one
first.

``` r
lead_agent$visualize_plan()
```

## Broadcasting

If you want to compare several `LLM` models, the `LeadAgent` provides a
`broadcast` method that allows you to send a prompt to several different
agents and get the result for each agent back in order to make a
comparison and potentially choose the best agent/model for the defined
prompt:

Let’s go through an example:

``` r
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_nano_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_nano_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)
```

``` r

lead_agent$clear_agents() # removing previous agents
lead_agent$register_agents(c(openai_4_1_agent, openai_4_1_nano_agent))
#> ✔ Agent(s) successfully registered.
```

``` r
lead_agent$broadcast(prompt = "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?")
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> [1] "55d5ae2c-76b0-4ef2-a67f-15d699c1a862"
#> 
#> [[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_agent"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1"
#> 
#> [[1]]$response
#> As an Algerian, you might enjoy singing "Ya Rayah" while running under the 
#> rain, and if you were a flower, you might prefer quietly soaking in the rain's 
#> nourishment instead of singing.
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$agent_id
#> [1] "70bdac96-3bcb-4189-bec7-67dc1156257c"
#> 
#> [[2]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_nano_agent"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_name

#> 
#> [[2]]$response
#> You might enjoy singing "Lila" by Cheb Khaled when running under the rain, and 
#> "Ya Rayah" for a flower, reflecting Algerian music and culture.
```

You can also access the history of the `broadcasting` using the
`broadcast_history` attribute:

``` r
lead_agent$broadcast_history
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$prompt
#> [1] "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$agent_id

#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_agent"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$response
#> As an Algerian, you might enjoy singing "Ya Rayah" while running under the 
#> rain, and if you were a flower, you might prefer quietly soaking in the rain's 
#> nourishment instead of singing.
#> 
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[2]]
#> [[1]]$responses[[2]]$agent_id
#> [1] "70bdac96-3bcb-4189-bec7-67dc1156257c"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[2]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_nano_agent"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[2]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"

#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[2]]$response
#> You might enjoy singing "Lila" by Cheb Khaled when running under the rain, and 
#> "Ya Rayah" for a flower, reflecting Algerian music and culture.
```

## Human In The Loop (HITL)

When executing an LLM workflow that relies on many steps, you can set
`Human In The Loop` (`HITL`) trigger that will check the model’s
response at a specific step. You can define a `HITL` trigger after
defining a `LeadAgent` as follows:

``` r
openai_llm_object <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

lead_agent$set_hitl(steps = 1)
#> ✔ HITL successfully set at step(s) 1.

lead_agent$hitl_steps
#> [1] 1
```

After setting the `HITL` to step 1, the workflow execution will pose and
give the user 3 choices:

1.  Continue the execution of the workflow as it is;
2.  Change manually the answer of the specified step and continue the
    execution of the workflow;
3.  Stop the execution of the workflow (hard error);

Note that you can set a `HITL` at several steps, for example
`lead_agent$set_hitl(steps = c(1, 2))` will set the `HITL` at step 1 and
step 2.

## Judge as a decision process

Sometimes you want to send a prompt to several agents and pick the best
answer. In order to choose the best prompt, you can also rely on the
`Lead` Agent which will act a dudge and pick for you the best answer.
You can use the `judge_and_choose_best_response` method as follows:

``` r
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_1 <- Agent$new(
  name = "stylist",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_2 <- Agent$new(
  name = "stylist2",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  credentials = retrieve_open_ai_credential, 
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Stylist Leader",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

stylist_lead_agent$register_agents(c(stylist_1, stylist_2))
#> ✔ Agent(s) successfully registered.

best_answer <- stylist_lead_agent$judge_and_choose_best_response(
  "what's the best way to wear a blue kalvin klein shirt in winter with a pink pair of trousers?"
)

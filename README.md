`mini007` provides a lightweight and extensible framework for
multi-agents orchestration processes capable of decomposing complex
tasks and assigning them to specialized agents.

Each `agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. `mini007` relies
heavily on the excellent `ellmer` package but aims to make it easy to
create a process where multiple specialized agents help each other
sequentially in order to execute a task.

`mini007` provides two types of agents:

- A normal `Agent` containing a name and an instruction,
- and a `LeadAgent` which will take a complex prompt, split it, assign
  to the adequate agents and retrieve the response.

#### Highlights

üß† Memory and identity for each agent via `uuid` and message history.

‚öôÔ∏è Built-in task decomposition and delegation via `LLM`.

üîÑ Agent-to-agent orchestration with result chaining.

üåê Compatible with any chat model supported by `ellmer`.

You can install the development version of `mini007` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/mini007")
```

``` r
library(mini007)
```

### Creating an Agent

An Agent is built upon an LLM object created by the `ellmer` package, in
the following examples, we‚Äôll work with the `OpenAI` models, however you
can use any model/combination of models you want:

``` r
# no need to provide the system prompt, it will be set when creating the
# agent (see the 'instruction' parameter)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)
```

After initialising the `ellmer` LLM object, creating the Agent is
straightforward:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "POLAR BEAR RESEARCHER",
  instruction = "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Each created Agent has an `agent_id` (among other meta information):

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$agent_id
#> [1] "f47583f5-944d-4793-bad4-29eb696c933e"
```

At any time, you can tweak the `llm_object`:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=1 tokens=0/0 $0.00>
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ system [0] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears.
```

An agent can provide the answer to a prompt using the `invoke` method:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$invoke("Are polar bears dangerous for humans?")
#> Yes, polar bears can be dangerous for humans. They are powerful predators and 
#> are known to be aggressive if they feel threatened or are hungry. Polar bears 
#> are the largest land carnivores, with adult males weighing between 900 to 1,600
#> pounds (410 to 720 kg), and they have strong jaws and sharp claws. Because they
#> live in remote Arctic regions where human presence is limited, encounters are 
#> rare, but when they do occur, polar bears can pose a significant threat to 
#> human safety. It is important for people in polar bear habitats to take 
#> precautions, such as carrying deterrents and avoiding surprise encounters, to 
#> minimize the risk of attacks.
```

You can also retrieve a list that displays the history of the agent:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "Are polar bears dangerous for humans?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> Yes, polar bears can be dangerous for humans. They are powerful predators and 
#> are known to be aggressive if they feel threatened or are hungry. Polar bears 
#> are the largest land carnivores, with adult males weighing between 900 to 1,600
#> pounds (410 to 720 kg), and they have strong jaws and sharp claws. Because they

#> human safety. It is important for people in polar bear habitats to take 
#> precautions, such as carrying deterrents and avoiding surprise encounters, to 
#> minimize the risk of attacks.
```

Or the `ellmer` way:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=3 tokens=36/131 $0.00>
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ system [0] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

### Creating a multi-agents orchestraction

We can create as many Agents as we want, the `LeadAgent` will dispatch
the instructions to the agents and provide with the final answer back.
Let‚Äôs create three Agents, a `researcher`, a `summarizer` and a
`translator`:

``` r

researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "researcher",
  instruction = "You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer factual questions with detailed and accurate information. Do not answer with more than 2 lines",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

summarizer <- Agent$new(
  name = "summarizer",
  instruction = "You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 distinct bullet points.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

translator <- Agent$new(
  name = "translator",
  instruction = "Your role is to translate a text from English to German",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Now, the most important part is to create a `LeadAgent`:

``` r
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Note that the `LeadAgent` cannot receive an `instruction` as it has
already the necessary instructions.

Next, we need to assign the Agents to `LeadAgent`, we do it as follows:

``` r
lead_agent$register_agents(c(researcher, summarizer, translator))
lead_agent$agents
#> [[1]]
#> <Agent>
#>   Public:
#>     agent_id: 8da36dee-f15a-49da-ba98-edfa95eeb029
#>     broadcast_history: list
#>     clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
#>     initialize: function (name, instruction, llm_object) 
#>     instruction: You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer fact ...
#>     invoke: function (prompt) 
#>     llm_object: Chat, R6
#>     messages: list
#>     model_name: gpt-4.1-mini
#>     model_provider: OpenAI
#>     name: researcher
#>   Private:
#>     .add_assistant_message: function (message, type = "assistant") 
#>     .add_message: function (message, type) 
#>     .add_user_message: function (message, type = "user") 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> <Agent>
#>   Public:
#>     agent_id: 91301051-ea22-41e4-b2b9-ed82832ed6ba
#>     broadcast_history: list
#>     clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
#>     initialize: function (name, instruction, llm_object) 
#>     instruction: You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 d ...
#>     invoke: function (prompt) 
#>     llm_object: Chat, R6
#>     messages: list
#>     model_name: gpt-4.1-mini
#>     model_provider: OpenAI
#>     name: summarizer
#>   Private:
#>     .add_assistant_message: function (message, type = "assistant") 
#>     .add_message: function (message, type) 
#>     .add_user_message: function (message, type = "user") 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> <Agent>
#>   Public:
#>     agent_id: 997f9209-bac2-45e1-bf07-de8968e2a5c2
#>     broadcast_history: list
#>     clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
#>     initialize: function (name, instruction, llm_object) 
#>     instruction: Your role is to translate a text from English to German
#>     invoke: function (prompt) 
#>     llm_object: Chat, R6
#>     messages: list
#>     model_name: gpt-4.1-mini
#>     model_provider: OpenAI
#>     name: translator
#>   Private:
#>     .add_assistant_message: function (message, type = "assistant") 
#>     .add_message: function (message, type) 
#>     .add_user_message: function (message, type = "user")
```

In order now to execute the workflow, we just need to call the `invoke`
method which will behind the scene delegate the prompts to suitable
Agents and retrieve back the final information:

``` r
response <- lead_agent$invoke("Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German.")
```

``` r
response
#> - Das Wirtschaftswachstum Algeriens ist bescheiden, mit einem Anstieg des BIP 
#> um etwa 2-3 %, haupts√§chlich getragen von √ñl- und Gaseinfuhren.  
#> - Die Arbeitslosenquote ist hoch, insbesondere bei Jugendlichen, mit Raten 
#> zwischen 12-15 %.  
#> - Die Wirtschaft ist stark von Kohlenwasserstoffen abh√§ngig (√ºber 90 % der 
#> Exporte), neben den Sektoren Landwirtschaft und Dienstleistungen.
```

If you want to inspect the multi-agents orchestration, you have access
to the `agents_interaction` object:

``` r
lead_agent$agents_interaction
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> 8da36dee-f15a-49da-ba98-edfa95eeb029

```

The above example is extremely simple, the usefulness of `mini007` would
shine in more complex processes where a multi-agent sequential
orchestration has a higher value added.

## Broadcasting

If you want to compare several `LLM` models, the `LeadAgent` provides a
`broadcast` method that allows you to send a prompt to several different
agents and get the result for each agent back in order to make a
comparison and potentially choose the best agent/model for the defined
prompt:

Let‚Äôs go through an example:

``` r
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_nano_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_nano_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)
```

``` r

lead_agent$clear_agents() # removing previous agents
lead_agent$register_agents(c(openai_4_1_agent, openai_4_1_nano_agent))
```

``` r
lead_agent$broadcast(prompt = "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?")
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> [1] "89adf885-9007-44ce-add1-2f5b02084dc2"
#> 
#> [[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_agent"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1"
#> 
#> [[1]]$response
#> If you were Algerian, you might sing "Ya Rayah" under the rain, while a flower 
#> might "sing" the gentle melody of "Fleur d'Alg√©rie."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$agent_id
#> [1] "9f6b97f1-8c52-4357-acdc-9bb3b860a337"
#> 
#> [[2]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_nano_agent"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-nano"
#> 
#> [[2]]$response
#> If you were Algerian, you might enjoy singing "Zina" by Souad Massi when 
#> running under the rain and "Azzam" by Cheb Khaled when admiring a flower.
```

You can also access the history of the `broadcasting` using the
`broadcast_history` attribute:

``` r
lead_agent$broadcast_history
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$prompt
#> [1] "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$agent_id
#> [1] "89adf885-9007-44ce-add1-2f5b02084dc2"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_agent"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$responses[[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1"
#>

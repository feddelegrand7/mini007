`mini007` provides a lightweight and extensible framework for
multi-agents orchestration processes capable of decomposing complex
tasks and assigning them to specialized agents.

Each `agent` is an extension of an `ellmer` object. `mini007` relies
heavily on the excellent `ellmer` package but aims to make it easy to
create a process where multiple specialized agents help each other
sequentially in order to execute a task.

`mini007` provides two types of agents:

- A normal `Agent` containing a name and an instruction,
- and a `LeadAgent` which will take a complex prompt, split it, assign
  to the adequate agents and retrieve the response.

#### Highlights

üß† Memory and identity for each agent via `uuid` and message history.

‚öôÔ∏è Built-in task decomposition and delegation via `LLM`.

üîÑ Agent-to-agent orchestration with result chaining.

üåê Compatible with any chat model supported by `ellmer`.

üßë Possibility to set a Human In The Loop (`HITL`) at various execution
steps

You can install `mini007` from `CRAN` with:

``` r
install.packages("mini007")
```

``` r
library(mini007)
```

### Creating an Agent

An Agent is built upon an LLM object created by the `ellmer` package, in
the following examples, we‚Äôll work with the `OpenAI` models, however you
can use any model/combination of models you want:

``` r
# no need to provide the system prompt, it will be set when creating the
# agent (see the 'instruction' parameter)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)
```

After initializing the `ellmer` LLM object, creating the Agent is
straightforward:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "POLAR BEAR RESEARCHER",
  instruction = "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Each created Agent has an `agent_id` (among other meta information):

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$agent_id
#> [1] "15e168bb-710f-4787-8635-8ae6a9bd3586"
```

At any time, you can tweak the `llm_object`:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=1 tokens=0/0 $0.00>
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ system [0] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max.
```

An agent can provide the answer to a prompt using the `invoke` method:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$invoke("Are polar bears dangerous for humans?")
#> [1] "Yes, polar bears are dangerous to humans as they are powerful predators and can be aggressive if threatened or searching for food."
```

You can also retrieve a list that displays the history of the agent:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$role
#> [1] "user"
#> 
#> [[2]]$content
#> [1] "Are polar bears dangerous for humans?"
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$role
#> [1] "assistant"
#> 
#> [[3]]$content
#> [1] "Yes, polar bears are dangerous to humans as they are powerful predators and can be aggressive if threatened or searching for food."
```

Or the `ellmer` way:

``` r
polar_bear_researcher$llm_object
#> <Chat OpenAI/gpt-4.1-mini turns=3 tokens=43/24 $0.00>
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ system [0] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

#> Yes, polar bears are dangerous to humans as they are powerful predators and can be aggressive if threatened or searching for food.
```

### Managing Agent Conversation History

##### Only in the development version at the moment

The `clear_and_summarise_messages` method allows you to compress an
agent‚Äôs conversation history into a concise summary and clear the
message history while preserving context. This is useful for maintaining
memory efficiency while keeping important conversation context.

``` r
# After several interactions, summarise and clear the conversation history
polar_bear_researcher$clear_and_summarise_messages()
#> ‚úî Conversation history summarised and appended to system prompt.
#> ‚Ñπ Summary: The user asked if polar bears are dangerous to humans, and the expert responded that polar bears are...
polar_bear_researcher$messages
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$role
#> [1] "system"
#> 
#> [[1]]$content
#> [1] "You are an expert in polar bears, you task is to collect information about polar bears. Answer in 1 sentence max. \n\n--- Conversation Summary ---\n The user asked if polar bears are dangerous to humans, and the expert responded that polar bears are indeed dangerous due to their strength and potential aggression when threatened or hungry."
```

This method summarises all previous conversations into a paragraph and
appends it to the system prompt, then clears the conversation history.
The agent retains the context but with reduced memory usage.

### Creating a multi-agents orchestraction

We can create as many Agents as we want, the `LeadAgent` will dispatch
the instructions to the agents and provide with the final answer back.
Let‚Äôs create three Agents, a `researcher`, a `summarizer` and a
`translator`:

``` r

researcher <- Agent$new(
  name = "researcher",
  instruction = "You are a research assistant. Your job is to answer factual questions with detailed and accurate information. Do not answer with more than 2 lines",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

summarizer <- Agent$new(
  name = "summarizer",
  instruction = "You are agent designed to summarise a give text into 3 distinct bullet points.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

translator <- Agent$new(
  name = "translator",
  instruction = "Your role is to translate a text from English to German",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Now, the most important part is to create a `LeadAgent`:

``` r
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)
```

Note that the `LeadAgent` cannot receive an `instruction` as it has
already the necessary instructions.

Next, we need to assign the Agents to `LeadAgent`, we do it as follows:

``` r
lead_agent$register_agents(c(researcher, summarizer, translator))
#> ‚úî Agent(s) successfully registered.
lead_agent$agents
#> [[1]]
#> <Agent>
#>   Public:

#>     .add_user_message: function (message, type = "user") 
#>     .set_turns_from_messages: function ()
```

Before executing your prompt, you can ask the `LeadAgent` to generate a
plan so that you can see which `Agent` will be used for which prompt,
you can do it as follows:

``` r
prompt_to_execute <- "Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German."

plan <- lead_agent$generate_plan(prompt_to_execute)
#> ‚úî Plan successfully generated.
plan
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> ed81c0b5-ae9e-442b-96e4-100122e223a7
#> 
#> [[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "researcher"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[1]]$prompt
#> [1] "Research and gather current information about the economic situation in Algeria, focusing on key aspects such as GDP growth, major industries, and recent economic challenges."
#> 
#>

#> 
#> [[2]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[2]]$prompt
#> [1] "Summarize the gathered information into 3 clear and concise bullet points."
#> 
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [[3]]$agent_id
#> 362f9181-35c9-4199-a61b-8591a763e94f
#> 
#> [[3]]$agent_name
#> [1] "translator"
#> 
#> [[3]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[3]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-mini"
#> 
#> [[3]]$prompt
#> [1] "Translate the 3 bullet points summarizing Algeria's economic situation into German."
```

Now, in order now to execute the workflow, we just need to call the
`invoke` method which will behind the scene delegate the prompts to
suitable Agents and retrieve back the final information:

``` r
response <- lead_agent$invoke("Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, summarize it in 3 bullet points, then translate it into German.")
#> 
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ Using existing plan ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> 
```

``` r
response
#> [1] "- Das BIP-Wachstum Algeriens zu Beginn des Jahres 2024 ist moderat und liegt bei etwa 2-3 %, was eine Erholung von den vergangenen √ñlpreisschocks widerspiegelt.  \n- Die Wirtschaft ist stark von Kohlenwasserstoffen abh√§ngig, insbesondere von √ñl und Gas, die etwa 90 % der Exporterl√∂se ausmachen, neben den Sektoren Landwirtschaft und Bauwesen.  \n- Wichtige Herausforderungen sind die wirtschaftliche Diversifizierung, hohe Arbeitslosigkeit, Inflation und sozialer Druck f√ºr Reformen angesichts volatiler √ñlpreise."
```

If you want to inspect the multi-agents orchestration, you have access
to the `agents_interaction` object:

``` r

The above example is extremely simple, the usefulness of `mini007` would
shine in more complex processes where a multi-agent sequential
orchestration has a higher value added.

## Broadcasting

If you want to compare several `LLM` models, the `LeadAgent` provides a
`broadcast` method that allows you to send a prompt to several different
agents and get the result for each agent back in order to make a
comparison and potentially choose the best agent/model for the defined
prompt:

Let‚Äôs go through an example:

``` r
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

openai_4_1_nano_agent <- Agent$new(
  name = "openai_4_1_nano_agent", 
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.", 
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)
```

``` r

lead_agent$clear_agents() # removing previous agents
lead_agent$register_agents(c(openai_4_1_agent, openai_4_1_nano_agent))
#> ‚úî Agent(s) successfully registered.
```

``` r
lead_agent$broadcast(prompt = "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?")
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$agent_id
#> [1] "84a0103a-1776-4620-8f6e-ad6c93825e17"
#> 
#> [[1]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_agent"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[1]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1"
#> 
#> [[1]]$response
#> [1] "If you were Algerian, you might enjoy singing \"Ya Rayah\" by Dahmane El Harrachi while running under the rain, and if you were a flower, you might simply bask in the rainfall, expressing joy through gentle movements."
#> 
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [[2]]$agent_id
#> [1] "13abd06e-e3ce-4adf-8f82-2fa4729e629a"
#> 
#> [[2]]$agent_name
#> [1] "openai_4_1_nano_agent"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_provider
#> [1] "OpenAI"
#> 
#> [[2]]$model_name
#> [1] "gpt-4.1-nano"
#> 
#> [[2]]$response
#> [1] "You might enjoy singing \"Tan Only,\" a popular Algerian song, and for a flower, \"Bougainvillea\" could inspire a joyful feeling."
```

You can also access the history of the `broadcasting` using the
`broadcast_history` attribute:

``` r
lead_agent$broadcast_history
#> [[1]]
#> [[1]]$prompt
#> [1] "If I were Algerian, which song would I like to sing when running under the rain? how about a flower?"
#>

## Tool specification

As mentioned previously, an `Agent` is an extension of an `ellmer`
object. As such, you can define a tool that will be used, the exact same
way as in `ellmer`. Suppose, we want to get the weather in `Algiers`
through a function (Tool). Let‚Äôs first create the `Agents`:

``` r
openai_llm_object <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), 
  echo = "none"
)

assistant <- Agent$new(
  name = "assistant",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant that answers question. Do not answer with more than 1 sentence.",
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

weather_assistant <- Agent$new(
  name = "weather_assistant",
  instruction = "You role is to provide weather assistance.",
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)
```

Now, let‚Äôs define the `tool` that we‚Äôll be using, using `ellmer` it‚Äôs
quite straightforward:

``` r
get_weather_in_algiers <- ellmer::tool(
  function() {
    "35 degrees Celcius, it's sunny and there's no precipitation."
  },
  name = "get_weather_in_algiers",
  description = "Provide the current weather in Algiers, Algeria."
)
```

Our `tool` defined, the next step is to register it within the suitable
`Agent`, in our case, the `weather_assistant` `Agent`:

``` r
weather_assistant$llm_object$register_tool(get_weather_in_algiers)
```

That‚Äôs it, now the last step is to create the `LeadAgent`, register the
`Agents` that we need and call the `invoke` method:

``` r
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

lead_agent$register_agents(c(assistant, weather_assistant))
#> ‚úî Agent(s) successfully registered.

lead_agent$invoke(
  "Tell me about the economic situation in Algeria, then tell me how's the weather in Algiers?"
)
#> 
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ Generating new plan ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> 
#> ‚úî Plan successfully generated.
#> [1] "The current weather conditions in Algiers are as follows: The temperature is 35 degrees Celsius, it is sunny, and there is no precipitation. If you need information on humidity or forecasts, please let me know!"
```

## Human In The Loop (HITL)

When executing an LLM workflow that relies on many steps, you can set
`Human In The Loop` (`HITL`) trigger that will check the model‚Äôs
response at a specific step. You can define a `HITL` trigger after
defining a `LeadAgent` as follows:

``` r
lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Leader", 
  llm_object = openai_llm_object
)

lead_agent$set_hitl(steps = 1)
#> ‚úî HITL successfully set at step(s) 1.

lead_agent$hitl_steps
#> [1] 1
```

After setting the `HITL` to step 1, the workflow execution will pose and
give the user 3 choices:

1.  Continue the execution of the workflow as it is;
2.  Change manually the answer of the specified step and continue the
    execution of the workflow;
3.  Stop the execution of the workflow (hard error);

Note that you can set a `HITL` at several steps, for example
`lead_agent$set_hitl(steps = c(1, 2))` will set the `HITL` at step 1 and
step 2.

## Judge as a decision process

#### Only in the development version at the moment

Sometimes you want to send a prompt to several agents and pick the best
answer. In order to choose the best prompt, you can also rely on the
`Lead` Agent which will act a dudge and pick for you the best answer.
You can use the `judge_and_choose_best_response` method as follows:

``` r
openai_4_1 <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_1 <- Agent$new(
  name = "stylist",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1
)

openai_4_1_nano <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_2 <- Agent$new(
  name = "stylist2",
  instruction = "You are an AI assistant. Answer in 1 sentence max.",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_nano
)

openai_4_1_mini <- ellmer::chat(
  name = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  echo = "none"
)

stylist_lead_agent <- LeadAgent$new(
  name = "Stylist Leader",
  llm_object = openai_4_1_mini
)

stylist_lead_agent$register_agents(c(stylist_1, stylist_2))
#> ‚úî Agent(s) successfully registered.

best_answer <- stylist_lead_agent$judge_and_choose_best_response(
  "what's the best way to wear a blue kalvin klein shirt in winter with a pink pair of trousers?"
)
